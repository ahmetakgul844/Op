As we announced last month, we've started the process of migrating our testnet from Kovan to Goerli. In line with the migration, we've updated this changelog to no longer reference the Kovan testnet. If you haven't already, please migrate your apps to Goerli using the URLs described below:

- **Public Endpoint:** [https://goerli.optimism.io](https://goerli.optimism.io)
- **Block Explorer:** [https://blockscout.com/optimism/goerli/](https://blockscout.com/optimism/goerli/)

For more information about the migration process, please see our [dev blog](https://dev.optimism.io/kovan-to-goerli/) and follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OPLabsPBC) for updates.
